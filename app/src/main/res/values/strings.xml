    Whether \'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep;
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to â€” tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wishd. To die, to sleep;</string>
